### Actor
An [`Actor`] is any kind of [entity] (an automated process, a persona or end user, for instance) that performs actions on a system. See [Actor Pattern] for further information.

### Boolean
A [`Boolean`] is a data type than can have only two possible values: `true` or `false`. See [Boolean Type] for further information.

### Command
A [`Command`] is a [`Feature`] that performs an action that changes the state of a system.

### Feature
A [`Feature`] is the smallest indivisible behavior that an [`Actor`] of a system can perform, and it can also be thought of as a distinctive aspect of a `Story`. As described by the [Command And Query Separation principle], there are only two types of behaviors or features: [`Command`]s and [`Query`]ies.

### Query
A [`Query`] is a type of [`Feature`] that performs an action that does **not** change the state of a system. It just retrieves information from a system.

### Set
A [`Set`] is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. See [Set Type] for further information.

### String
A [`String`] is just an arbitrary long sequence of characters. See [String Type] for further information.
